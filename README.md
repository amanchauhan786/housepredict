# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A machine learning application that predicts house prices based on property features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. This project demonstrates regression modeling, providing an example of using data to predict continuous values.

<!--
IMPORTANT: A plot showing the model's predictions vs. actual prices would be a great visualization to add here!

## 🌟 Project Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates house prices from given features. The project involves:

* Data cleaning and preparation
* Model training
* Model evaluation using metrics like **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Load & Clean Data** – Handle missing values and prepare the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Encode categorical data, scale features if needed.
3. **Data Splitting** – Train/Test split to evaluate on unseen data.
4. **Model Training** – Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, or Gradient Boosting.
5. **Prediction** – Use the trained model to predict house prices.
6. **Evaluation** – Compare predictions with actual values using R² and MSE.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (Core language)
* **Pandas** (Data handling)
* **Scikit-learn** (Modeling & evaluation)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Optional visualizations)

---

## 📊 Dataset

You can use one of the following datasets:

* **Boston Housing Dataset** (classic ML dataset)
* **California Housing Dataset** (based on 1990 census data)

These datasets include features like:

* Per capita crime rate
* Average number of rooms
* Property tax rate
* Median home value

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python **3.6+** installed

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/amanchauhan786/housepredict.git
cd housepredict

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate venv (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate venv (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## ✍️ How to Run

Make sure the dataset is present in the project directory, then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 📈 Model Performance

After execution, you’ll see metrics like:

* **R² Score** – Closer to **1** means better performance.
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – Lower value indicates better accuracy.

Example output:

```
R² Score: 0.82  
MSE: 2450000.34  
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* [ ] Try advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).
* [ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
* [ ] Engineer new features for improved accuracy.
* [ ] Deploy as a **Flask** or **Streamlit** web app for user interaction.
